#Longest Common Subsequence#

###Challenge Description:###

You are given two sequences. Write a program to determine the longest common subsequence between the two strings (each string can have a maximum length of 50 characters). NOTE: This subsequence need not be contiguous. The input file may contain empty lines, these need to be ignored.

###Input sample:###

The first argument will be a path to a filename that contains two strings per line, semicolon delimited. You can assume that there is only one unique subsequence per test case. E.g.
```
XMJYAUZ;MZJAWXU
```
###Output sample:###

The longest common subsequence. Ensure that there are no trailing empty spaces on each line you print. E.g.

```
MJAU
```
