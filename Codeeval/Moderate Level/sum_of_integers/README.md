#Sum of integers#

###Challenge Description:###

Write a program to determine the largest sum of contiguous integers in a list.

###Input sample:###

The first argument is a path to a filename containing a comma-separated list of integers, one per line.

For example:
```
-10,2,3,-2,0,5,-15
2,3,-2,-1,10
```
###Output sample:###

Print to stdout the largest sum. In other words, of all the possible contiguous subarrays for a given array, find the one with the largest sum, and print that sum.

For example: 
```
8
12
```
